## Geometrically Preserved Ensembles of Single Class Classifiers on Point Clouds, Time Series, and Graphs

This is a demonstration for a range of anomaly detection algorithms for high-dimensional point cloud, time-series and graphs. These approaches include:

- high-dimensional point clouds:
  - Isolation Forest[1]
  - KNN[2]
  - Local Outlier Factor[3]
  - Principal Component Analysis (PCA)[4]
  - One-Class Support Vector Machine (OCSVM)[5]
- time series
  - Tensor Decomposition[6]
  - Dynamic Time Warping[7]
  - Matrix Profiling[8]
- graph
  - Non-negative Matrix Factorisation (NMF)[9]
  - Oddball[10]
  - SCAN[11]
  - Eigenspokes[12]

We show case our key contribution to ensemble models using the Wasserstein Barycentre. Wasserstein Barycentre provides a geometrically meaningful way to aggregate probability distributions based on the theory of optimal transport.
