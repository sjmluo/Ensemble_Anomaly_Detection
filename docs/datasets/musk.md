The original musk dataset from [UCI machine learning repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php) contains several musk and non-musk classes. The non-musk classes j146, j147, and 252 are combined to form the inliers, while the musk classes 213 and 211 are added as outliers without downsampling. Other classes are discarded.
