The original lymphography dataset from [UCI machine learning repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php) is a classification dataset. It is a multi-class dataset having four classes, but two of them are quite small (2 and 4 data records). Therefore, those two small classes are merged and considered as outliers compared to other two large classes (81 and 61 data records).
