A collection  of tweet samples using the [Twitter Streaming API](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs) for the World Cup 2014 season (June 12–July 13). The tweets are filtered by popular/official World Cup hashtags, such as #worldcup, #fifa, #brazil, etc. Entity-entity co-mention temporal graphs are constructed using a 5 minute sample rate (8640 time points). The outlier detection method was applied to the network that was initially sampled.

Edges coloured ❗red❗ are considered anomalous by the model.
