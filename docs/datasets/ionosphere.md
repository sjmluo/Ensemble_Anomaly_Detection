The original ionosphere dataset from [UCI machine learning repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php) is a binary classification dataset with dimensionality 34. There is one attribute having values all zeros, which is discarded. So the total number of dimensions are 33. The ‘bad’ class is considered as outliers class and the ‘good’ class as inliers.
