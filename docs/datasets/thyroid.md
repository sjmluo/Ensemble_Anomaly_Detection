The original thyroid disease (ann-thyroid) dataset from [UCI machine learning repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php) is a classification dataset, which is suited for training ANNs. It has 3772 training instances and 3428 testing instances. It has 15 categorical and 6 real attributes. The problem is to determine whether a patient referred to the clinic is hypothyroid. Therefore three classes are built: normal (not hypothyroid), hyperfunction and subnormal functioning. For outlier detection, 3772 training instances are used, with only 6 real attributes. The hyperfunction class is treated as outlier class and other two classes are inliers, because hyperfunction is a clear minority class.
