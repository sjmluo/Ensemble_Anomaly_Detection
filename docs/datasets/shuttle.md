The original Statlog (Shuttle) dataset from [UCI machine learning repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php) is a multi-class classification dataset with dimensionality 9. Here, the training and test data are combined. The smallest five classes, i.e. 2, 3, 5, 6, 7 are combined to form the outliers class, while class 1 forms the inlier class. Data for class 4 is discarded.
