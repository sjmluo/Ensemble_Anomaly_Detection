Epinions is a bipartite network consisting of a user-post rating network. 
Ground truth labels are assigned to 'fraudulent' users based off an independent trust network consisting of the users in the rating network.

This is a who-trust-whom online social network of a a general consumer review site Epinions.com. Members of the site can decide whether to ''trust'' each other. All the trust relationships interact and form the Web of Trust which is then combined with review ratings to determine which reviews are shown to the user.
