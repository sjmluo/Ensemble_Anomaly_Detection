The original arrhythmia dataset from [UCI machine learning repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php) is a multi-class classification dataset with dimensionality 279. There are five categorical attributes which are discarded here, totalling 274 attributes. The smallest classes, i.e., 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 14, 15 are combined to form the outliers class and the rest of the classes are combined to form the inliers class.
