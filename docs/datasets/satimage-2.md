The original Statlog (Landsat Satellite) dataset from [UCI machine learning repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php) is a multi-class classification dataset. Here, the training and test data are combined. Class 2 is down-sampled to 71 outliers, while all the other classes are combined to form an inlier class. The modified dataset is referred to as Satimage-2.
