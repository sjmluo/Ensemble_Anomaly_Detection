Briefly, the building dataset is physically set-up as follows:

The building dataset was an extensive investigation in applying:

 1. Different levels of damage, at
 2. Different locations on the structure, with
 3. Different voltage levels.

In order to model the steady progression of damage on our structure we considered the following transition:

**Healthy -> Mild damage at location 1C -> Large damage at location 1C -> Large damage at locations 1C and 3A**

where mild damage is taken to mean loosening of a bolt, and large damage is taken to mean complete removal of a bracket which holds the strut at that location.
