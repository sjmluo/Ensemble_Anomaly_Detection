This is a simulated collection of noisy circular graphs where nodes 1-12 are nodes that make up the circular network (i.e. the true network) and nodes 13+ are noisy elements of the network.

These instances of the noisy networks are combined by calculating the barycentre shown as the large graph at the bottom.

For each network, the outlier detection is applied, thereby predicting anomalous nodes for each of the noisy graphs and the barycenter.

Nodes coloured ❗red❗ are determined to be anomalous by the model.
